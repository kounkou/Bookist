# Bookist

It is true that the best way to learn something to its deepest level is the ability to share it to other people. In the age of Artificial intelligence, why not just read a generated summary made by an AI you might ask ? The answer is that reading something generated by AI still doesn't answer the question if you understand something at its deepest level. We postulate that writing the summary yourself is still the best way, and more rewarding way to learn about something, and ultimately understand it. Bookist is an application that helps people create and share their summary of a book, article, paper, etc. to friends family and the world.
